Exploratory analysis allows to understand better the underlying data structure, distribution (outliers), relationships amongst variables and allows to identify potential trends. 

First, we check the experimental design (balanced, unbalance) and whether there is any correlation amongst variables (biological as well as technical). 

The plot below shows pairwise comparisons of all variables, highlighting significant correlations and similarities (Pearson corr. test for two continuous variable, chi-square/equal proportions for two categorical variables, Anova for a continuous and a categorical variable).

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principle component analysis (PCA) is used simplify complex datasets by transforming them into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the relevant information. Visualizing principle component (PC) allows to identify clusters, outliers, trends or other potential trends.

The following plots represent PCAs performed using the top 1000 most variable CpGs. Plotted are the first 4 principal components labeled with the variables of interest (sentrix id, sex sample group).  

PCA plots based on the top 100, 5000 or 10000 most variable CpGs are located in the following directory: 

```{r}
# Display the Heatmap folder path
paths$bplots_folder
```

#### PC correlation analysis

Testing for significant correlations between principal components and (all) variables given in the sample sheet allos to identify batch effect and important biological variables.

### Heatmap 

Hierarchical clustering based on pairwise distances provides another way to identify potential groups of samples. By default the heatmap function provides hierarchical clustering of a value matrix (beta values) by columns (samples) and rows (probes). The actual values are represented as colors (0=blue, 1=red). The heatmap below is created from the 1000 most variable CpG.

Heatmaps in this context are useful to confirm an expected grouping as well as visualizing the individual values (and subsequently difference) for each group. 

Heatmaps created with the top 100, 5000 and 1000 most variable CpGs are stored in the following directory: 

```{r}
# Display the Heatmap folder path
paths$heatmap_folder
```
